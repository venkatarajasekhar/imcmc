  Currently only emcee sampler has been included, later I will include in other commonly used
algorithms, such as Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs, Hamiltonian, etc ..

  How about writing a paper on the design of the structure of imcmc?

Mar-19-2015
  Add support for derived parameters. [not finished]

Mar-27-2015
  Add convergence check/diagnosis [not finished]

Oct-10-2015
  Planned to add other algorithms, i.e., the traditional Metropolis-Hastings,
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and an interface to MultiNest.

Oct-12-2015
  Write a document.

    add the option to restart the sampling from some place. also add the option to adjust the number
    of CPUs in use, i.e., after testing (burning) using very few cores, one can immediately first
    stop the sampling and then change the settings in ini-file and re-run the job submission.

    void ensemble_workspace::restart(***);

    inside this function, the number of walkers should not be changed!!!

	implement additional check of sample points, those who have NOT move for MANY times.
	These points are not expected, since they occurence might indicate some peculiar or even
	ridiculous properties of posterior distribution function in the neighborhood of that point.

Jan-08-2016
	Prepare to upgrade parser, adding new structures to store readed key-value pairs, so all
	contents will be read in once for all.  When we need value(s) of some key, just query that
	from the struture(s).
